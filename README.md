# Pokemondreamteam
## Concept and Why?
As a user, register your name and save information to the database so that you can keep information about your team and my pokemon. Search up any pokemon in the first generation, and gain access to them anywhere! 

We wanted to be able to have and share our favorite pokemon! There are so many now that it can be hard to keep track of them and easy to forget some of your favorites!

## Tech Used
We used our own database of the first 151 pokemon, as well as Sequel, Express, Node.Js, handlebars.js, Morgan, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
## Future Development
Update the character database to add the other generations, as well as the new Pokemon that come out 
Ability to add your favorite pokemon and multiple teams
Filter the pokemon by things like type, alphabetical order, number, ect.
Add in more information about each pokemon (moves, catch rate, ect.)
Sharing with friends your dashboard to show off your team and favorites!
